Sometimes, the documentation is going to leave you scratching your head.

In a very early assignment at Launch School,
you are tasked with writing a program that loads some text messages from a YAML file.
We do this with YAML::load_file:

require 'yaml'
MESSAGES = YAML.load_file('calculator_messages.yml')

Find the documentation for YAML::load_file.
