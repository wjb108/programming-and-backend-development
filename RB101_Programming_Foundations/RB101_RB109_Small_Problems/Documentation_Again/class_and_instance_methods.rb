Locate the ruby documentation for methods File::path and File#path.
How are they different?
File::path is a class method,
while File#path is an instance method.
Class methods are called on the class,
while instance methods are called on objects. 
Thus:

puts File.path('bin')

calls the class method File::path since we're calling it on the File class, while:

f = File.new('my-file.txt')
puts f.path

calls the instance method File#path
since we're calling it on an object of the File class, namely f.

Pay attention when reading the documentation;
make sure you are using a class method when you need a class method,
and an instance method when you need an instance method.
